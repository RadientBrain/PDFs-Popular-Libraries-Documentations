# Combined PDF Documentation

This project is storage for pdfs of popular libraries documentation where pdfs are not available online.

## What is this repo about?

I wanted to create this repo because I was not getting pdfs of many popular library documentations in pdf format and thought to do it myself.

## Usage

- This is a small help from me to the community as many people were facing this issue, so use these files however you like for research, improvement, learning, etc.

## Contributions

I am not thinking to have PR's merged as I have no option as of now to test the pdfs that are contributed for their validity and full content, also there can be some malwares that someone can inject in pdfs to harm the PCs of public so you all can create an issue and suggest the pdfs that you want in this repo and I will do my best to add these pdfs in the repo ASAP.

Just make sure the issues created for the requests are concise, understandable and in EN language.
